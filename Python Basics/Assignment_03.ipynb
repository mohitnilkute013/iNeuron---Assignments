    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Functions are advantageous in programs because they promote code organization, reusability, and modularity. They allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions into a single unit that can be easily invoked whenever needed. This enhances code readability, reduces redundancy, and makes debugging and maintenance more efficient. Functions enable you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts, making your codebase more organized and easier to understand."

    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it&#39;s specified or when it&#39;s called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is specified/defined."

    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. It defines the logic and behavior to achieve the desired outcome. A function call, on the other hand, is the act of invoking or executing a specific function to perform its defined tasks. In short, a function is a defined piece of code, while a function call is the action of using that code to achieve a specific result."

    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The concept of a return value in programming refers to the value that a function can send back to the caller once it has executed its tasks. It allows functions to provide results or data that can be used further in the program. Yes, it is possible to have a return value in an expression. In short, a return value is the output that a function generates and can be used in expressions for calculations, assignments, or other operations."

    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable. If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the `global` keyword to declare which variables are global."
